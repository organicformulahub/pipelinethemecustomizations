Shopify Pipeline theme customizations

This repository is intended to document how the Organic Formula Hub dev team made some distinct shopify theme customizations for their store. 

Our website is: https://organicformulahub.com 

We are using the Pipeline theme by GroupThought. 


### Some notable modifications:
- Display a metafield for "starting from" prices on the pricing page that corresponds to a metafield for EACH product which contains the lowest price for that particular product.
